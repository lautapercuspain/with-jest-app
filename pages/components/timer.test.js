Here is an example of a unit test for the Timer component using Jest and React Testing Library:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import Timer from './Timer';

describe('Timer', () => {
  it('renders the timer with initial value of 0', () => {
    render(<Timer />);

    const timerValue = screen.getByText(/0/i);

    expect(timerValue).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

To run this test, make sure you have Jest and React Testing Library installed, and then execute the test command in your project directory:

```
$ npm test
```

This test verifies that the Timer component renders with an initial value of 0. It uses the `render` function from React Testing Library to render the component, and the `getByText` function to find the element containing the value "0". The `expect` statement then checks if the element is in the document.

You can add more tests to cover different scenarios or behaviors of the Timer component.
