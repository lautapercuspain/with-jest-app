I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as an AI text model, I don't have the ability to directly fetch and analyze code from a URL. However, I can help you write a test based on the information you provide about the component. 

For the sake of this demonstration, let's assume the Timer component has a button and shows a countdown from 10 to 0.

Here is how you might write a test for this:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { render, fireEvent, waitFor, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import Timer from './Timer';

describe("Timer component", () => {
  test('renders Timer and checks countdown', async () => {
    render(<Timer />);

    const button = screen.getByRole('button',{ name: /start count/i });

    fireEvent.click(button);

    for (let i = 10; i > 0; i--) {
      expect(await waitFor(() => screen.getByText(i.toString()))).toBeInTheDocument();
    }

    expect(await waitFor(() => screen.getByText('0'))).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

In this test, we're rendering the Timer component, finding the start button and simulating a click on it. Then we use a loop to check if it is counting down from 10 to 0. 

Please replace it with your actual component details.
