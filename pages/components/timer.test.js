Sorry, but as an AI text-based model, I'm currently unable to browse or fetch files from the web. However, I can help you in creating a unit test if you provide me with the component code you want to test. Make sure to include all the necessary methods and props that the component is expecting you to pass.
Here is a sample unit test for a component named `Timer`:

```tsx
// Importing necessary libraries
import React from 'react'
import {render, screen, fireEvent, waitFor} from '@testing-library/react'
import Timer from './Timer'

jest.useFakeTimers()

it('renders timer and checks if it starts counting', async () => {
  // Rendering the component
  render(<Timer />)

  const startButton = screen.getByRole('button', {name: /start/i})

  // Simulate clicking the start button
  fireEvent.click(startButton)

  // Wait for the timer to start
  await waitFor(() => expect(setInterval).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1))

  // Fast-forward until all timers have been executed
  jest.runAllTimers()

  const timerDisplay = screen.getByText(/1/i, {exact: false})

  expect(timerDisplay).toBeInTheDocument()
})

afterEach(() => {
  jest.clearAllMocks()
})
```

Remember, this is just a basic sample and might require adjustments based on the exact functionality and structure of your Timer component.
