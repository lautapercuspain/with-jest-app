Sure, here is a basic unit test for the Timer component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen, waitFor, fireEvent, cleanup } from '@testing-library/react';
import Timer from './Timer';

// Clean up after each test
afterEach(cleanup);

test('renders timer component and starts count', async () => {
  const { getByRole } = render(<Timer />);
  
  // Check if timer is initially at 0
  let timer = screen.getByRole('timer');
  expect(timer.textContent).toBe('0');
  
  // Find the start button and click
  const startButton = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /start/i });
  fireEvent.click(startButton);

  // Wait and check if timer count increases
  await waitFor(() => {
    timer = screen.getByRole('timer');
    expect(timer.textContent).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
});
```

Please note that this is a basic test and might need to be adjusted based on the actual implementation of the Timer component. The component should have the roles 'timer' and 'button' appropriately assigned for this test to work.
